CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update & Delete. These are the four basic operations which are executed on Database Models. We are developing a web app which is capable of performing these operations.

1. Read Operation
    The ability of the application to read data from the database.

2. Create Operation
    The ability of the application to store data in the database.

3. Update Operation
    The ability of the application to edit the stored value in the database.

4. Delete Operation
